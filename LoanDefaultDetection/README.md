Prediction of credit default using machine learning and PySpark. 

## Description
In this project I analyze a Credit Default dataset, available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mishra5001/credit-card), to build a machine learning model to predict if a loan application will default. This project involves , visualization of data

## Running the notebook
Running the code in the notebook requires downloading the file from Kaggle and unzip in a "files" folder that resides in the main working directory.
